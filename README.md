# Analysis of the USA Road Accidents
### Descriptive and Inferential Statistics Conducted on the Kaggle's US Road Accidents Data Set.
***Project includes the following files:***  
***- US_RoadAccidents.ipynb -> jupyter notebook file containing whole analysis***  
***- US_Accidents_Dec20.csv -> csv file with records as of Decemeber 2020***

#### The motivation of the project is two-branch. In the first part I try to answer questions posed with regard to USA accidents' hot spots. The objective is to try to figure it out, what kind of characteristics define an accident hot spot and which roads among all routes in USA seem to be most dangerous. In the second part I deal with supervised learning model, were I try to predict the severity of an accident (in terms of traffic obstructions)

***This project serves in the first line the fulfillment of the exercise requirements of the first part of the Udacity's "Data Scientist" Nanodegree. Nevertheless, the data set used for this exercise contains actuall records and can be used to drag insights leading to real applications. 
The data set can be retrived from the following link (acutal version) https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents  
Version used for my analysis has been attached in form of csv file to this repository  <br/><br/><br/><br/>

### The code is written in Python 3.7.3. Required libraries to run the project:

Python basic libraries:
- math
- random  <br/><br/>

Python data science libraries:
- pandas
- numpy

Python visualistion libraries:
- matplotlib
- seaborn <br/><br/>

Python machine learning libraries:
- sklearn <br/><br/>

Python geospatial data science libraries:
- geopandas
- geoplot (Python 3.6+ only!) <br/><br/>  

Possible installation is via Anaconda Prompt. For all libraries the command `conda install "library_name"` will work. The geoplot has to be installed over the Forge Channel:  `conda install geoplot -c conda-forge`
